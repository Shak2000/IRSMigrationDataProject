enrich_county_data.py — Milestone 1.3

Enriches any IRS county inflow or outflow CSV by adding missing county/state
info and writing a standardised output schema:

    y2_state, y2_state_name, y2_statefips, y2_countyfips, y2_county_name,
    y1_statefips, y1_countyfips, y1_state, y1_state_name, y1_county_name,
    n1, n2, AGI

Lookup source: county_fips.csv — a unified file produced by parse_fips.py that
combines rows from both Census geocode vintages:
  • All counties from all-geocodes-v2021.csv (covers 2021–22 IRS FIPS codes)
  • Connecticut planning-region rows from all-geocodes-v2025.csv appended
    (covers 2022–23 IRS FIPS codes for CT: 09110–09190)
  A single lookup therefore resolves county names for both 2021–22 and 2022–23
  IRS data without needing per-file FIPS selection.

Inflow files  (e.g. countyinflow2122.csv):
    y2 = destination county — only y2_statefips + y2_countyfips present;
    y2_state, y2_state_name, y2_county_name must be derived from the lookup.
    y1 = origin — raw file has y1_state (postal) and y1_countyname; only
    y1_state_name must be added from the lookup.

Outflow files (e.g. countyoutflow2122.csv):
    y1 = origin county — only y1_statefips + y1_countyfips present;
    y1_state, y1_state_name, y1_county_name must be derived from the lookup.
    y2 = destination — raw file has y2_state (postal) and y2_countyname;
    only y2_state_name must be added from the lookup.

Special aggregate FIPS codes used by IRS (not real geographies):
  State-level:  96 = US+Foreign total, 97 = US total, 98 = Foreign total,
                57 = Foreign
  County-level: 000 = state aggregate, 001 = same-state total,
                003 = different-state total
These receive canonical descriptive labels so no row is left blank.
